# Python wheel platform tags

Kshana's optional Python extension (`pip install kshana`) ships **abi3** wheels — one wheel per
platform, valid across CPython ≥ 3.9 — built by `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` on every `v*` tag
(and on manual dispatch). The build matrix and the resulting platform tags:

| Platform | Runner | maturin `--target` | Wheel platform tag |
|----------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Linux x86_64 | `ubuntu-latest` | `x86_64` | `manylinux_2_28_x86_64` |
| **Linux aarch64** | `ubuntu-latest` (QEMU in manylinux container) | `aarch64` | `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` |
| **macOS arm64** | `macos-latest` (Apple-silicon runner) | `aarch64` | `macosx_*_arm64` |
| macOS x86_64 | `macos-latest` (cross-compiled from Apple-silicon, avoiding the scarce `macos-13` Intel runner) | `x86_64` | `macosx_*_x86_64` |
| Windows x64 | `windows-latest` | `x64` | `win_amd64` |
| **Windows arm64** | `windows-11-arm` (native) | `aarch64` | `win_arm64` |

The Python ABI tag is `cp39-abi3` everywhere (PyO3 `abi3-py39`), so a single wheel per row covers
all supported interpreter versions.

## ABI floor (Linux)

The Linux wheels are pinned to the **`manylinux_2_28`** container (GLIBC 2.28 — RHEL 8 / Ubuntu
20.04 era). `auditwheel show` (the PyPA reference tool) is run in CI on each Linux wheel and the
job **fails** unless the wheel is tagged `manylinux_2_28_<arch>`, so the ABI floor is enforced
independently of Kshana for both x86_64 and aarch64.

## ARM verification

- The **aarch64 Linux** wheel cross-builds under QEMU inside the manylinux container, and a
  best-effort `arm-install-smoke` job (`runs-on: ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `continue-on-error`)
  `pip install`s it on a native ARM64 runner `--only-binary :all:` (no source build) and imports
  the module — proving the wheel is installable on real ARM hardware.
- The **macOS arm64** wheel builds natively on the Apple-silicon `macos-latest` runner.
- The **Windows arm64** wheel builds **natively** on a GitHub-hosted `windows-11-arm` runner
  (target `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`); building on the runner's own architecture avoids the
  abi3 cross-build platform-tag mismatch that skips the wheel on an x86-64 host.

## Producing the release assets

The wheels become PyPI assets when the founder cuts a tagged release (the workflow fires on the
`v*` tag and uploads each wheel as a build artifact; the publish step pushes them to PyPI). The
engineering — the full cross-platform/cross-arch build + the auditwheel ABI gate — is in place; the
remaining step is the tagged release itself.
